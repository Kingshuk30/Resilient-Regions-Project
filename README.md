# Resilient-Regions-Project
The following project contains a csv file with temperature data over various years for five different cities. It also contains a jupyter notebook that describes the consensus of opinions ('for', 'against' or 'neutral') among a population of 50 people (35 common men, 10 businessmen and 5 ecologists) over time via the models: DeGroot, Friedkin-Johnsen, Bounded Confidence, Stochastic Bounded Confidence, taking into consideration the change in temperature over time and different thresholds and influence functions to include this temperature factor.

This file is still in its draft stage. It will be updated soon.
